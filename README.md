# Bayesian-Statistical-Analysis-of-CO2-Emissions-Data


## Introduction

This is the final project for the class 'Bayesian Learning and Montecarlo Simulation'. It involves an analysis of CO2 emissions data by applying Bayesian statistical methods.


## Datasets & Outline

We have included two main datasets in our analysis.

  - **Dataset 1** encompasses annual CO2 emissions for each year from 1900 to 2022. This dataset provides a comprehensive perspective on CO2 emissions over more than a century, allowing us to identify long-term trends and patterns.

  - **Dataset 2** is more granular and concentrates on the years 2006 to 2009. It includes various features such as energy use per capita, GDP, population, CO2 emissions per capita, the percentage of low-carbon energy in total energy production, urbanization levels, and internet usage. This dataset allows for a detailed analysis of specific factors that may influence CO2 emissions during a recent, focused timeframe.


We will focus on:

  - **Long-Term Trends**: Using Dataset 1, we will examine how CO2 emissions have evolved over the past century, identifying key periods of increase or decrease and correlating these with historical events.

  - **Recent Factors** Influencing CO2 Emissions: With Dataset 2, we will analyze the impact of socio-economic and technological factors on CO2 emissions from 2006 to 2009. This includes investigating the relationship between CO2 emissions and variables such as energy consumption, economic activity, urbanization, and the adoption of low-carbon energy sources.

  - **Comparative Analysis**: We will compare findings from both datasets to understand how historical trends relate to more recent developments.

By integrating these two datasets, we aim to analyse CO2 emissions over time and identify the factors driving changes in recent years.
